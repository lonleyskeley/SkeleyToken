# SkeleyToken
An advanced Discord token grabber that snipes tokens from more than 20 different sources. It's not overly bloated and it does the job.
Characteristics
- A reasonable amount of code.
- No local caching, invisibility.
- A Discord webhook can be used to send tokens and other data.
- Only a small percentage of antivirus programs detect this as a virus.
- Looks for tokens in 15+ sources.
- Collects the majority of computer data.
- Easily obfuscated and packaged as an EXE.
- Checks to see if any alt-accounts are logged into the same PC and snipes their tokens as well.
- Validates tokens in order to prevent request/webhook spam.
- Retrieves general information about a user (*username, phone number, and so on*).
- Shows a neat embed with all the information you require.
